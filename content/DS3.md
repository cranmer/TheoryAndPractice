I took over has Executive Director of the Moore Sloan Data Science Environment (MSDSE) in late 2018. 
One of my major initiatives in 2019 was the launch of [Data Science and Software Services (DS3](https://cds.nyu.edu/ds3/)) at NYU.

The Data Science & Software Services (DS3) creates a central service for faculty and research staff to access expertise in data science and statistical methodology as well as software engineering aligned with research goals. DS3 aims to enhance the research capacity of NYU by providing highly skilled labor for funded projects and increasing the competitiveness of grant proposals.

DS3 is a joint undertaking of the Center for Data Science Moore-Sloan Data Science Environments (MSDSE) project, the NYU Libraries, NYU IT Research Technology, and the PRIISM Center, with connections to affiliated services such as Data Services, High Performance Computing (HPC), NYU IT Teaching and Learning with Technology (TLT), and more.
