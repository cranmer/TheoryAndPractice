Well I caught the fever for the 750 GeV excess too. While ATLAS policies prevent me from submitting a paper to the arXiv about a preliminary result, I couldn't help but write up [these thoughts](http://bit.ly/1Y34QbT) on the excess in the context of Supersplit Supersymmetry. Note, they do not represent any offical view of the ATLAS collaboration.

We clearly need more data, but these are exciting times. The analysis in the paper reveals many interesting and subtle statistical considertions. On the face of it, supersplit supersymmetry is excluded with 2-3$\sigma$ confidence. However, I also go so far as to propose a new *phenothropic principle* that explains this tension as a new form of tuning with a non-anthropic selection mechnaism.
