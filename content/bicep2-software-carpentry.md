This week NYU hosted a [Software Carpentry Bootcamp](http://software-carpentry.org/bootcamps/index.html) along with Berkeley and U. Washington (the other institutes in the Moore-Sloan data science environment).  I sat in on the python classes (there were also classes in R).  However, on Monday, there was a _huge_ announcement from the [BICEP2](http://bicepkeck.org) collaboration about the observation of B-mode polarization in the CMB, which is considered a smoking gun for primordial gravitational waves predicte by inflation. That made it hard to concentrate on python, but I tried to merge the two. I noticed that BICEP2 made their likelihood curve public. I also noticed that they got a bit mixed up with their Bayesian and Frequentist statistics (at least the terminology), so that gave me an idea.  
Here's a link to my [iPython notebook on alternate BICEP2 error analysis](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/url/cranmer.github.io/downloads/notebooks/BICEP2_likelihood.ipynb?create=1)
