I was a big fan of [Zope][] early on (late 90's) and always wanted to do
some fun web-based projects.  One of the more successful ones was
[LaTeXWiki][], which was one of the first wiki plugins where you could
write LaTeX.    Unfortunately, I was always sufficiently confused about
some aspect of Zope that most of my projects only worked out with the
help of friends like Sean, Joe, Jeff, Bob, and Stephen.

The [old theoryandpractice][] site ran on Zope, but it hasn't been
touched in years.  I spent so much time getting a 3-collumn CSS layout
back in the early CSS days that it basically killed my interest.  Now
I'm rebooting theoryandpractice.org (love that name) with wordpress and
I'm hoping to tinker with some of the new technologies like D3
and [Flask][].  Wish me luck!
