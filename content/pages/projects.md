Pointers to some projects

-   [RooStats][]: The statistical tools used widely at the LHC, and
    almost exclusively for the Higgs discovery.
-   [RECAST][]: A project to make it possible to reinterpret
    experimental results in the context of a different theoretical
    model.
-   [INSPIRE][]: The literature database for HEP (I'm on the advisory
    board)
-   [UnicodeIt][] a little tool that lets me type this "H\\to
    \\gamma\\gamma" and turn it into H→ γγ (anywhere due to unicode)
    with a little system-wide hotkey.
-   [EventView][] an analysis framework used widely inside ATLAS in the
    early days
