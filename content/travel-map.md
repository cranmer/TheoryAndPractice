I'm starting to work on a year in review (2025 edition). As part of that, I wanted to create a map of my travels. That turned into a little project to use claude code. I made a tool that will extract date and location from a set of photos (one for each travel destination) and then create a travel map for me. 

I've also always wanted to visualize my "world line" that tracks my path through space-time. 

Here's the tool:

 * [Travel Map on GitHub](https://github.com/cranmer/travel-map)
 * [Travel Map Gallery](https://theoryandpractice.org/travel-map/)

## The result:
